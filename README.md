# Neural-Network
# Project Name
MultiVerse Neural Talk - Multi Lingual(English, Bangla) Chatbot Experiment For Neural Network Course 

## Description

This repository contains code and resources related to three different natural language processing projects:

1. **ChatBot_English.ipynb**: A Python notebook implementing a chatbot using neural networks trained on English conversations.
2. **Translation_English_To_Bangla.ipynb**: A notebook demonstrating language translation functionality from English to Bengali.
3. **ChatBot_Bangla.ipynb**: Another notebook focused on a chatbot trained on Bengali conversations.

These notebooks utilize Python, TensorFlow, and neural network techniques for creating multi-lingual chatbots.

## Project Descriptions

### ChatBot_English.ipynb

#### Overview
This notebook implements a chatbot using neural networks trained on English conversations. It uses a provided dataset ('dialogs.txt') that includes columns 'question' and 'answer'.

#### IPython Notebook Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

#### Dataset
- **dialogs.txt**: This dataset serves as the foundation for training the English chatbot. It contains conversational pairs of questions and corresponding answers.

### Translation_English_To_Bangla.ipynb

#### Overview
This notebook demonstrates language translation functionality from English to Bengali. It operates using a translation library and provides a translation output file ('output_dataset_bengali_exp_1.txt') based on the input English sentences.

#### IPython Notebook Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- mtranslate (for language translation)
- translate (for language translation)

#### Dataset
- **dialogs.txt**: The input dataset containing English sentences.
- **output_dataset_bengali_exp_1.txt**: The resulting dataset with translated Bengali sentences.

### ChatBot_Bangla.ipynb

#### Overview
A notebook focused on training a chatbot with Bengali conversations. It utilizes the 'exp_bangla.txt' dataset for this purpose.

#### IPython Notebook Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

#### Dataset
- **exp_bangla.txt**: This dataset serves as the foundation for training the Bengali chatbot. It contains conversations in the Bengali language.

### ChatBot_Bangla_Test_Case.ipynb

#### Overview
A test case notebook designed to validate the Bengali chatbot. It uses testing procedures to ensure the chatbot's functionality and accuracy.

#### IPython Notebook Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Error Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Empty Dataset
- **Fault**: Dataset might be empty or improperly loaded.
- **Solution**: Verify the dataset is properly loaded and contains data.

#### Data Loading Issues
- **Fault**: Issues during data loading process.
- **Solution**: Check the code responsible for loading data to ensure it functions correctly.

#### Data Preprocessing
- **Fault**: Preprocessing results in an empty dataset.
- **Solution**: Review preprocessing steps to avoid unintended data loss or modifications.

#### Data Shape Mismatch
- **Fault**: Mismatch in input data shape or format.
- **Solution**: Ensure the input data matches the model's expected format and shape.

#### Debugging with Print Statements
- **Fault**: Difficulty identifying points of failure in the code.
- **Solution**: Insert print statements strategically to pinpoint issues during code execution.
